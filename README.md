# Switched Flux Magnet Motor - Mk2
This device is a progression from the Switched Flux Transmission devices I have been developing (my SFT repo has those models). Those devices were designed to switch magnetic flux by interposing a ferromagnetic sheet in the gap between two opposing magnetic poles in the belief that the energy required to pass such a sheet through the magnetic gap would be less than could be obtained by the consequent flux switching.
The SFT devices required an energy input to power the flux switching. This design, however, should run with no energy input, just due to the geometry of the device and the arrangement of the magnets and ferromagnetic sheets.

In this design there is a central rotor, a cylinder, that has two opposed sinusoidal cam grooves cut into the sides of the cylinder. Wherever the tracks converge there is a ferromagnetic sheet that attracts the magnets, which are arranged on sliding carriages such that their poles oppose. The carriages are mounted on shafts that constrain them to move only along the shafts. The carriages also have bearings that are constrained to run in the cam grooves. Thus, where the cam grooves converge the magnets are in attraction to the ferromagnetic sheet in the gap between them and wherever the tracks diverge there is no ferromagnetic sheet in the gap, meaning the opposed poles will repel. When the bearings impose a force on the cam track they cause the cylinder to rotate.
